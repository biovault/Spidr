# Spatial Information in Dimensionality Reduction (Spidr)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/460389824.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/460389824)

Introduces spatial neighborhood information in dimensionality reduction for high-dimensional images. 
Extends t-SNE such that similarities are based on a point's spatial neighborhood instead of only the high-dimensional point itself.

To clone the repo and its external submodules (hnswlib, glfw, spdlog):

```git clone --recurse-submodule https://github.com/biovault/Spidr/```

Currently, tested on Windows with Visual Studio 2019. Use cmake for setting up the project:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64
```

The standard cpp implementation uses the A-tSNE implementation from the [HDILib](https://github.com/biovault/HDILib) and [Hnswlib](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib) for approximated nearest neighbor search. Other DR techniques might also be used, as shown in the python example below.

## Usage

See `example/SpidrExample.cpp` for an example on how to use the library in cpp.

See `python_wrapper` for install intructions and an example on how to use the library in python. The example showcases spatially informed t-SNE, UMAP and MDS embeddings.

## Dependencies
Not all dependencies are included in this repo (see submodules in `external/`): 
- [HDILib](https://github.com/biovault/HDILib) (by default, cmake will download a pre-built version of this library. You can also set the cmake variable `USE_ARTIFACTORY_LIBS` to FALSE and define the path variables HDILIB_ROOT, FLANN_ROOT and LZ4_ROOT by hand. See the HDILib documentation for more detail on the HDILib and it's dependencies.)
- OpenMP
